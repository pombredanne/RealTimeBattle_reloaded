Finally some news on RealTimeBattle!

<p>
* The homepage will move to <A HREF="http://www.lysator.liu.se/realtimebattle">the
computer club of the local university</A>. This means easier maintainance and hopefully
more frequent updates. The <A HREF="http://realtimebattle.netpedia.net">netpedia
homepage</A> will probably be used as a mirror for some time, but please update your
bookmarks and links to the new site.

<p>
* We have now abandoned the wwwboard in favour for two 
<A HREF="http://www.lysator.liu.se/realtimebattle/Lists">mailing lists</A>
realtimebattle-announce and realtimebattle-d, for announcements and discussions.

<p>
* Version 0.9.8 of RealTimeBattle is released. New features include a replay function
to review old games, a new robot option to disable non-blocking pipes, which can make
it easier to construct robots, and a smarter tournament startup window, making it
faster to start and restart tournaments.

See the <A HREF="Documentation/ChangeLog.#HTML#">change
log</A> for more info on news in 0.9.8.

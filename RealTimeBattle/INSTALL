 Installation
 ------------

 Installing RealTimeBattle should not be too difficult; in case you get
 problems, please send your bug report to rtb@users.sourceforge.net and
 tell what went wrong.


 To compile and install RealTimeBattle, you only need to execute the
 following commands:

 % ./configure [options]
 % make
 # make install

 If you install to directories other than your own, you have to be root. 
 Observe that GNU make should be used. If make fails, try gmake instead.




 Options
 -------

 You can change the settings by supplying options to configure, e.g. if
 you want a different install directory, compile in debug mode or turn
 off graphics or native language supprt. A full list of options is
 listed by

 % ./configure --help

 The following options are especially useful:

  --prefix=DIR              The root directory for all installed files,
                             default: /usr/local
  --exec-prefix=DIR         Root for architecture-dependent files,
                             default: prefix
  --bindir=DIR              Where the RealTimeBattle binary is placed,
                             default: eprefix/bin
  --datadir=DIR             Where data is installed,
                             default: prefix/share
  --includedir=DIR          Where Messagetypes.h is installed,
                             default: prefix/include
  --infodir=DIR             Where info-files are stored,
                             default: prefix/info
  --with-rtb-dir            Directory for main installation,
                             default: eprefix/games/RealTimeBattle
  --disable-nls             Do not use Native Language Support.
  --with-included-gettext   Use the GNU gettext library included here.
  --with-nls-localedir=PATH Directory where your locales are,
                             default: datadir/locale
  --enable-debug            Compile for debugging.
  --disable-graphics        Compile a version without a gui.
  --without-gtk             Same as --disable-graphics.

 
 Note that the default --prefix setting has from v0.9.11 been changed
 to /usr/local from /usr that was the default prior to v0.9.11. If you
 still want to use /usr, configure using the command

 % ./configure --prefix=/usr


 If you have an old version of RealTimeBattle, it could be necessary to
 remove the old version first (especially if you change the --prefix
 option).

 If you need to supply extra flags to the c or c++ compiler, you can do
 this by changing CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS respectively. For example, using
 bash,

 % export CXXFLAGS=-Wall

 will add '-Wall' when compiling a c++ program. 




 Compiling for another directory
 -------------------------------

 It is possible to compile RTB from another directory than the top
 source directory. To do this follow these steps:

 % mkdir /path/to/RTB/builddir
 % cd /path/to/RTB/builddir
 % /path/to/RTB/sourcedir/configure [options]
 % make

What is to do...
Everything
The original version was based on XFig 3.2 (It was just to see how it would look like), but we gonna try to do better this time (still modifying XFig).

Parse a file : This is the very begining and we try to parse a fill... 
Write a file : This will be the second part of the job
g++ XFig     : Modify XFig main functions to be compilable by g++
Modify XFig  : Modify the Canvas' functions of XFig

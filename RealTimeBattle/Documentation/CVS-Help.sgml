CVS help

<p>
If you want to get the very latest snapshot of RealTimeBattle, you are
advised to 
<url name="checkout the CVS tree from SourceForge"
url="https://www.sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=561">. On this page there
are more information on how to use CVS. It is also possible to browse the
source there.

<descrip>
<tag>Checking out:</tag>
<p>
To check out simply do as follows:

Note that the main branch at the cvs is in developing stage and may not
compile at all, so don't expect it to work.

First set the environmental variable CVSROOT to
<verb>:pserver:anonymous@cvs.RealTimeBattle.SourceForge.net:/cvsroot/RealTimeBattle</verb>
by using
<tt>%export CVSROOT=</tt> if you are using <tt>bash</tt> or similar shells.
or <tt>%setenv CVSROOT=</tt> if you are using <tt>tcsh</tt> or similar shells.

Then go on and and login to the server and checkout:
<verb>
%cvs login
%cvs co RealTimeBattle</verb>
or if you want to check out the stable branch of the RealTimeBattle tree
you have to do this:
<verb>
%cvs login
%cvs co -r release-1-0-0-patches RealTimeBattle</verb>

<tag>Requirements:</tag> 
<p>

To compile RTB from the cvs you will need <tt>automake</tt>,
<tt>autoconf</tt> and <tt>sgml-tools (version 1.0.x) </tt>. The latter
isn't necessary if you don't need to compile the documentation.

<tag>Compiling:</tag> 
<p>

Before the actual compiliation can be started you need to create the
configure script:
<verb>
% aclocal
% automake
% autoconf</verb>

If everything goes well, you should be able to compile as usual now.

Note that <tt>automake</tt> needs the file 
<url name="gtk.m4" url="http://www.lysator.liu.se/realtimebattle/Download/gtk.m4">
, which isn't installed by default on some systems (e.g. FreeBSD).

<tag>Internationalization</tag>
<p>

To be able to create the *.gmo files you need to have <tt>gettext</tt>,
preferably <tt>gettext 0.10.35</tt> or later (see 
<url name="www.gnu.org" url="www.gnu.org"> to download).
<p>

If you don't want any other language than english, you don't need to
install <tt>gettext</tt>, but you have to configure using
<verb>
% configure --disable-nls</verb>

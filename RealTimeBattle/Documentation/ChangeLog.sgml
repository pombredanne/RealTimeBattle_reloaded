Change log
<itemize>

<item> <bf>1.1.0</bf>
<p>

New option: <tt>Max robots allowed simultaneously</tt>. This option allows
the user to change how many robots allowed in a sequence. Depending on how
many file-descriptors and maximum number of tasks allowed by the system.

RealTimebattle has now been translated to Japanese.

Some bugs have been fixed so Japanese translation works correct.

Fixed a problem with COLLISION giving wrong angle. Thanks to Nathan D Green.

Sorting by sequence in the statistics when viewing individual robots now
works again.

<item> <bf>1.0.0</bf>
<p>

No bugs found, thus v1.0.0 is pretty equal to v1.0.0pre1.

<item> <bf>1.0.0pre1:</bf>
<p>

German translation added (thanks to Uwe Hermann and Jan Suhr).

A new RealTimeBattle.spec has replaced the older one (thanks to CW
Zuckschwerdt).

Bug fixes for some problems under FreeBSD.

<item> <bf>0.9.11:</bf>
<p>
The default prefix for the installation has been changed from <tt>/usr</tt>
to <tt>/usr/local</tt>.

Polish translation added (thanks to Zbigniew Chyla).

Portuguese translation added (thanks to Rui Sousa).

Added info in the documentation on what the different things on the robot
are.

Fixed so it is possible to configure and compile RTB from another directory
than the RTB top sourcedir.

Fixed bug that caused rtb to segfault when it is impossible to open the
logfiled supplied on the command-line to be replayed.

Added so a message is displayed in the messagewindow when a robot has not
given any name, so it easy to know which robot that hasn't given any name.

Removed a memory-leak when adding messages (Note that there is still a lot
of leaking memory but this is gtk+'s fault).

Corrected code that caused a compile-time failure with gcc-2.95.

Changed so <tt>string.h</tt> is included instead of <tt>strings.h</tt>

<item> <bf>0.9.10:</bf>
<p>
The missing file IntlDefs.h has been added to the distribution.

<item> <bf>0.9.9:</bf>
<p>
Added support for internationalization. If you do not want native language support
configure with the command:
<verb>% ./configure --disable-nls</verb>

Messages are now displayed much faster in the message-window.

More dialogs to inform when something goes wrong (i.e. could not start tournament etc.)

Various minor improvements to the gui.

Added option <tt>Logging frequency</tt> to make log files less large.

Added two new warning messages: NAME&lowbar;NOT&lowbar;GIVEN and
COLOUR&lowbar;NOT&lowbar;GIVEN.

Robots does get a random colour instead of black if none is given. 

Fixed bug that caused rotate&lowbar;and&lowbar;fire&lowbar;select.cc
failed during compile on some slackware machines.

Fixed bug that caused the arena window not to be hidden correctly when hiding it at
the start of a tournament.

Fixed bug with show and hide windows that caused program failures.

Probably some other bugs too that I have forgot.

<item> <bf>0.9.8:</bf>
<p>
A new Robot Option: USE&lowbar;NON&lowbar;BLOCKING. By setting this option to false
robots input and output pipes are blocked, so that the robot automatically
waits for the next message when reading from the STDIN. If you use this,
signals are no longer necessary to inform about new messages.

Replay game. You can now replay a game form its log. Note that logfiles
made with earlier versions are incompatible with the replay function.

New game option: <tt>Fast forward factor</tt>, which determines how fast the game
will be when the fast forward or the rewind button is pressed.

The default RealTimeBattle installation-directory is now
<tt>EPREFIX/games/RealTimeBattle</tt> instead of
<tt>PREFIX/games/RealTimeBattle</tt>.

The robot <tt>Rotate and Fire</tt> now exists in three different versions,
all functionally equivalent, but using different methods for reading
messages: blocking, select and signals.

It is now possible to show hidden windows.

The window for starting tournaments now remembers the previous tournament
which is used as default the next time a tournament is to be played.

It is now possible to load and save tournaments in the start tournament window.

New game option: <tt>Robot startup time</tt>, the time between the
launching the robot processes and the beginning of the game.

New misc option: <tt>Directory for temporary files</tt>, a directory
where various temporary files are stored. Defaulted to /tmp/rtb

Possibility to use +,-,0 instead of pushing buttons zoom in, zoom out resp no zoom.

There are various changes in the look and feel, which hopefully improves the usability. 

<item> <bf>0.9.7:</bf>
<p>
Lots of internal changes, the class hierarchy is completely
redone. Hopefully this will have changed nothing in the behavior of RTB,
expect for: GTK+ is no longer necessary when compiling without graphics.

Optimizations. At least the non-graphics version should be a lot faster now.

It is now possible to redirect messages to a file or STDOUT.

Clicking on a robots name in the statistics window now results in showing
statistics for that robot.

Window resizing is working well for gtk 1.1.x and later.

For gtk 1.1.x and later you can now grab window positions and sizes via a button in the
options window.

Two new keywords added to the messaging language: DebugLine and 
DebugCircle. These can be used to draw directly to the arena when running
at the highest debug level. 

Everything about loading and saving has been removed. It is now legal to
read and write to files without restriction. Note that it can, however, be
restricted in competitions if the organizer wants to.

A thin line, marking the angle the robot is facing, is now drawn.

Some extra bits of information are now displayed in the window titles.

The robot 'Rotate and Fire' is more or less remade to be a slightly better
robot and a much better example.

The arena is now drawn using a normal right handed coordinate system instead of the
one used by gtk+ by default. The result is that everything is turned upside
down. Angles do now increase in the counterclockwise direction as they should.

New option: 'Update interval' which determines how often the robot positions
and radars are updated.

<item> <bf>0.9.6:</bf>
<p>
The installation procedure is completely changed. Now <tt>configure</tt> is used to make the program
easier to adjust to different systems (thanks to Martin Norb&auml;ck)

Log files of games can now be generated. The only problem is that they tend to be very large ...

Added sorting in the statistics. Only available with Gtk 1.1.x or later.

It is now possible to clear the message list and view messages from one robot only.

It is now possible to autostart a tournament. See docs to know how to do a tournament file.

It is now possible to choose a statistics file for saving the statistics when autostarting a
tournament.

You can now run RTB without any GUI, either by giving a command line option or by a compilation flag
(gtk+ is still required though).

Added window positions to options.

Bugfixes:

An updating problem with gtk 1.1.x in statistics window was solved.

<tt>Messagetypes.h</tt> is now LGPL'd instead of GPL'd.

Error handling is improved (by removing exception handling).

<item> <bf>0.9.5:</bf>
<p>
The resource-file is now implemented. Please write a <tt>.rtbrc</tt> for your favorite
settings. The easiest way of setting this is to click the <tt>Save as Default</tt>
button in the options window.

Changing of window sizes has been implemented. Change your <tt>.rtbrc</tt> for new default sizes.

The environmental variables <tt>RTB&lowbar;ROBOTDIR</tt> and
<tt>RTB&lowbar;ARENADIR</tt> are replaced with regular options. Place your default
directories in your <tt>.rtbrc</tt> for permanent options.

Added some buttons to the options window.

Load and Save buttons now uses the gtk file-selector.

The savefile-options is removed

Keyword <tt>Break</tt> is changed to the correct spelling <tt>Brake</tt>.

New robot option: <tt>SIGNAL</tt>, which will replace the old
<tt>SEND&lowbar;SIGNAL</tt>. You can now specify which signal to be sent.

A new warning message: <tt>OBSOLETE&lowbar;KEYWORD</tt>. Please replace all the
obsolete keywords with the corresponding new version as soon as possible, since
obsolete keyword will be completely removed within a number of releases and certainly
before 1.0. 

Long command line options are now available.

The Message output is changed into a clist and new messages are put at the top of the
list. Hopefully this is more readable.

Bugfixes:

Fixes for floating point problems in BSD (thanks to Dennis Cartier).

Recent Linux kernels seems to block <tt>SIGUSR1</tt>, this was fixed by a patch from Oliver 
Jowett. This bug applies to a lot of robots around, so be sure to add the corresponding code to your
robot!

No scrollbars were appearing in the clists when using Gtk+ 1.1.x. This is now fixed.

And a lot of smaller bugs, which I am too lazy to write down (thanks to various people).

<item> <bf>0.9.4:</bf>
<p>
More bugfixes:

 It should be working alright with Gtk+ 1.1.x now and
 problems with the environmental-variables are fixed.

And this time also some improvements:

 Enhanced debug-mode, you can now change debug-levels, kill specified robots or the current
game. Thanks to Ward & Pieter for the ideas.

 When a rotation has finished, the robot will now get a message if it wishes. Thanks to Artur
Adib for the suggestion.

 The included robots are no longer GPL'd, they have no license at all now! Feel free to
(ab)use as you wish, but don't blame us if there is a problem :-)

<item> <bf>0.9.3:</bf> 
<p>
Fixed more bugs. Thanks to Ronan Heffernan, Oliver Kurth, Adam C Luter and Bj&ouml;rn again.

<item> <bf>0.9.2:</bf> 
<p>
Fixed some bugs. Thanks to Bj&ouml;rn Augustsson for a detatiled bug-report. 

<item> <bf>0.9.1:</bf> 
<p>
This is the first ever public release of RealTimeBattle. Even though its the first, it should be
pretty stable and regarded as an alpha release of the forthcoming version 1.0. 
Please report any bugs you encounter. Especially if you have problem with the
messaging language, it has to be changed before version 1.0 is released, since thereafter the
messaging language is fixed and may not be altered (until version 2.0).

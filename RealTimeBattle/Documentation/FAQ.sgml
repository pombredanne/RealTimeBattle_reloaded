<tag>The program doesn't compile on my computer</tag> 
<p>
Please read the <tt>INSTALL</tt> file
carefully, and study the 
<url name="BUGS"
url="http://www.lysator.liu.se/realtimebattle/Documentation/BUGS.html">
file. Make sure you have got the latest version. If it still doesn't work,
send a bug report to 
<htmlurl name="rtb@users.sourceforge.net" url="mailto:rtb@users.sourceforge.net">
or 
<url name="SourceForge" url="https://www.sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=561"> 
and we will try to fix it as soon as possible.  

<tag>I have installed gtk, but configure doesn't find it</tag>
<p>
Check that <tt>gtk-config</tt> is in the path! You may need to set the
environmental variable <tt>GTK_CONFIG</tt> if, for example, the name of
<tt>gtk-config</tt> is changed.

<tag>My robot doesn't work as I expect</tag>
<p>
If your messages are not recognized at all, the problem may be that the STDOUT needs to be
flushed. In C++ this is done automatically by sending <tt>endl</tt> to <tt>cout</tt>, but in other
languages you have to do it explicitly.

Another common mistake is to forget whitespace between the arguments of a
message. This problem can be hard to find since the warning message is usually sent
too late or not at all. 

<tag>I can't replay a logfile made with RealTimeBattle-0.9.7</tag>
<p>
This is due to the fact that there were errors in the logfile-generator in
RealTimeBattle-0.9.7, thus alla logfiles from versions before 0.9.8 are incompatible
with the replay function.

<tag>How do I change the language in RealTimeBattle?</tag>
<p>
This is very simple. Just set the environmental variable LANG to your
language. In bash for example, use this:
<verb>% export LANG=en_US</verb>
Note that en_US is to be replaced with the language code that you want to use.

<tag>Which languages are available for RealTimeBattle?</tag>
<p>
There are, at this moment, five translations apart from english:
Polish, Portuguese, German, Swedish and Japanese.
